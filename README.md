# algos-and-data-structures

Repository contains algorithms and data structures for C++ and Python.
There are classic examples like bubble sort, finding n`th fibonacci number, binary tree, linked list, stack. Additionally, repository contains other algorithms and data structures that I find interesting during my coding adventures.
